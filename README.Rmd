### About this repository

This repository contains the comprehensive dataset for the [MeLiDos](www.melidos.eu) field study site of Kumasi, Ghana. Data were collected by [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST)](https://www.knust.edu.gh) and are further processed and analysed by the [Translational Sensory & Circadian Neuroscience Unit (TSCN)](https://www.tscnlab.org). A detailed description of the experiment is available in [Guidolin et al., 2024](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39592960).

This repository is transitioning towards a [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and fully human and machine-readable light exposure dataset, based on a [community-based and peer-reviewed Metadata descriptor](https://bmcdigitalhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44247-024-00113-9). As part of this transition, files will be converted from semi-rectangular data, to fully [tabular data](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/). Further, metadata will be added and converted from XLSX to JSON. For full traceability, all versions will be archived in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and are accessible through their own persistent identifier (DOI).

| **demographics** | N=1 csv files. Contains demographic information for N=15 participants. A lookup table links record_id with participant ID. |
| **discharge** | N=1 csv file, which contains answers from al. questionnaires that N=15 participants had to fill at discharge: 1) Light Exposure Behaviour Assessment (LEBA instrument), 2) Visual Light Sensitivity Questionnaire-8 (VLSQ-8), 3) Assessment of Sleep Environment (ASE) questionnaire, 4) Modified Theory Framework of Acceptability (mTFA) questionnaire, 5) Feedback (1 Y/N and multiple choice questions). A lookup table links record_id with participant ID. |
| **screening** | N=1 csv file for N=15 participants containing screening information. A lookup table links record_id with participant ID. |
