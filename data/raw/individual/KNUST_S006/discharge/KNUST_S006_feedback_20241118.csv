The feeling was normal since I knew the relevance of what I am wearing.","On Tuesday I went to a secondary school where all the students and teachers were staring at me and I was really uncomfortable with it, but I focused on the relevances and went through with confidence.    And on Thursday too, I was taking a public transport where entering with the light glasses on was difficult, but I managed to enter.    And on Saturday, because I had worn it for long, it was slipping to the edge of my nose, so i needed to be pushing it back most times.","So on Thursday, I went to seek for a marking opportunity that I can earn by it, and the officials were not comfortable with me wearing it, and it took me plenty words to make them cool down on it, though it reached the edge of me not been given the opportunity, but it was finally okay and I got it.","I increased in confidence, because the friends that I am with like teasing a lot, and for me to overcome this, I developed more confidence.    So on Tuesday, I was around Kejetia market and the Boys around came to me to ask about the glasses and the other items, they thought it was a camera that I have to spy them, but I confidently explained it to them, but it was a kinda serious moment.    so the adaptation was by me increasing in confidence and focusing on the aim, because I knew the end is better than those moments.","Yes there was.  I was Infront of a bank on Tuesday, and the security men came to me to ask about the glasses and I explained to them what I knew about it.    On Thursday, the opportunity that I went to seek, the people that came was plenty and most of them asked me questions about it.    And it was funny for them and also interesting to them when they hear about it. that I even got a name from them as ""Digital Digital"".","I would suggest that the light sensor be made smaller and the position should be at the edges if that is possible, thank you.",2
